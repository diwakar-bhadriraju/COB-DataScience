# Linear Regression Model for Predicting X and Y Values

## Overview

This project involves building a simple linear regression model using Python to predict 'x' and 'y' values. The dataset includes two CSV files, `train.csv` and `test.csv`, containing 'x' and 'y' values. The project includes data cleansing, model training, testing, and evaluation.

## Datasets

- **train.csv:** Contains 'x' and 'y' values for training the linear regression model.
- **test.csv:** Includes 'x' and 'y' values for testing the trained model and evaluating predictions.

## Project Structure

- **train_linear_regression_model.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for creating and training the linear regression model using the training dataset.

- **predict_value.py:** Python script allowing users to input either 'x' or 'y' and predicting the corresponding value using the trained model.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
